# da.ily (React)

This is a project that aims to recreate my [**da.ily**](https://satyamd8.github.io/da.ily/) website into a React web app.
So far, basic features on the frontend have been implemented.

## I'm currently working on:
- creating a Backend RESTful API with authentication to support and manage user profiles and data persistance for settings
- designing a relational scheme in PostgreSQL to store user data like personal information, task data, and UI preferences
- adding the rest of the Frontend features:
  - Chart.js graphs of the tasks
  - Schedule page with functioning calendar
  - Profile page with user profiles and saved preferences
  - Theme switching
